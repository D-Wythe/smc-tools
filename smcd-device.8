.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B smcd device
command displays SMC-D devices and their properties. 
The
.B smcr device
command displays SMC-R devices and their properties. 

.SS smcd,smcr device show
inspect the device properties

.TP
.B all  (default)
List all devices.

.TP
.BI netdev " NETDEV"
.B SMC-R
only: limit the command output to the device with the specified network device name.

.TP
.BI ibdev " IBDEV"
.B SMC-R
only: limit the command output to the device port with the specified RoCE device name.

.SH OUTPUT

.SS "Net-Dev"
Network device name.
.SS "IB-Dev"
RoCE (InfiniBand) device name.
.SS "IB-P"
InfiniBand port of the RoCE device. According to the InfiniBand conventions, the port count starts at 1. Consequently, devices where each port is represented as a separate device will indicate the port as the first port for all ports.
.SS "IB-State"
State of the RoCE device port.
.TP
.I
INACTIVE
The RoCE device port is inactive.
.TP
.I
ACTIVE
The RoCE device port is active.
.SS "Type"
Type of the underlying PCI device.
.TP
.I
RoCE_Express
Underlying used device is RoCE Express.
.TP
.I
RoCE_Express2
Underlying used device is RoCE Express 2.
.TP
.I
ISM
Underlying used device is ISM.
.SS "Crit / InUse"
Show whether the device is critical i.e. without failover possibility(SMC-R) or
whether the device is in use.(SMC-D)
.TP
.I
Yes
For SMC-R, there is at least one link group running on the
device with state "SINGLE" or locally "ASYMMETRIC" which
means one or more link groups without a failover device in case of a link failure.
In case of SMC-D, there is at least one link group running on the 
ISM device.
.TP
.I
No
For SMC-R, there is no link group running on the device with 
state "SINGLE" or locally "ASYMMETRIC" which means the link group(s) 
have a fallback device in case of a failure.
In case of SMC-D, there is no link group running on the ISM device.
.SS "FID"
Function ID of the PCI device.
.SS "PCI-ID"
ID of the PCI device.
.SS "PCHID"
Physical channel ID of the PCI device.
.SS "#Links"
Number of links (SMC-R)/link groups (SMC-D) on the device.
.SS "PNET-ID"
PNET ID of the device. Leading asterisk "*" means PNET ID is set by the user. (e.g "*PNET-ID")
