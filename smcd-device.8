.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B smcd device
command displays SMC-D devices and their properties. 
The
.B smcr device
command displays SMC-R devices and their properties. 

.SS smcd,smcr device show
inspect the device properties

.TP
.B all  (default)
Show all the devices.

.TP
.BI netdev " NETDEV"
.B SMC-R
only: list only the device with the given network device name.

.TP
.BI ibdev " IBDEV"
.B SMC-R
only: list only the device ports with the given RoCE device name.

.SH OUTPUT

.SS "Net-Dev"
Network device name.
.SS "IB-Dev"
RoCE (InfiniBand) device name.
.SS "IB-P"
InfiniBand port of the RoCE device. Note that per InfiniBand convention, the port counting starts at 1. Consequently, devices where each port is represented as a separate device will indicate the port as the first port for all ports.
.SS "IB-State"
State of the RoCE device port.
.TP
.I
INACTIVE
The RoCE device port is inactive.
.TP
.I
ACTIVE
The RoCE device port is active.
.SS "Type"
Type of the underlying PCI device.
.TP
.I
RoCE_Express
Underlying used device is RoCE Express.
.TP
.I
RoCE_Express2
Underlying used device is RoCE Express 2.
.TP
.I
ISM
Underlying used device is ISM.
.SS "Crit / InUse"
Show whether the device is critical i.e. without failover possibility(SMC-R) or
whether the device is in use.(SMC-D)
.TP
.I
Yes
In case of SMC-R, there is at least one linkgroup running on the
device with state "SINGLE" or locally "ASYMMETRIC" which
means the linkgroups do not have any fail-over device in case of
a failure.
In case of SMC-D, there is at least one linkgroup running on the 
ISM device.
.TP
.I
No
In case of SMC-R, there is no linkgroup running on the device with 
state "SINGLE" or locally "ASYMMETRIC" which means the linkgroup(s) 
have a fallback device in case of a failure.
In case of SMC-D, there is no linkgroup running on the ISM device.
.SS "FID"
Functional ID of the PCI device.
.SS "PCI-ID"
ID of the PCI device.
.SS "PCHID"
Physical channel ID of the PCI device.
.SS "#Links"
Number of links(SMC-R)/linkgroups(SMC-D) on the device.
.SS "PNET-ID"
PNET-ID of the device. Preceding "*" means PNET-ID is set by the user. (e.g "*PNET-ID")
