.SH OUTPUT

.SS "LG-ID"
ID of the link group.
.SS "LG-Role"
Role of the link group.
.TP
.I
SERV
The link group has a SERVER role.
.TP
.I
CLNT
The link group has a CLIENT role.
.SS "LG-Type"
Type of the link group.
.TP
.I
NONE
The link group has the initial type.
.TP
.I
SINGLE
The link group has only a single link, i.e.
the local and the peer system can offer one device port only for this link group,
which means a link outage on either side cannot be recovered.
.TP
.I
SYM
The link group has two symmetric links, i.e.
the local and the peer system can offer two device ports for this link group,
which means a link outage on either side can be recovered.
.TP
.I
ASYMP
The link group has asymmetric links, i.e.
the peer system can offer one device port only for this link group,
which means a link outage on the peer side cannot be recovered.
.TP
.I
ASYML
The link group has asymmetric links, i.e.
the local system can offer one device port only for this link group,
which means a link outage on the local side cannot be recovered.
.SS "VLAN"
The VLAN to which the link group belongs.
.SS "#Conns"
Number of connections(sockets) running on the link or link group.
.SS "PNET-ID"
PNET ID of the link group. Asterisk "*" means PNET ID is set by the user. 
.SS "Net-Dev"
Network device name corresponding to the link.
.SS "Link-State"
The state of the link.
.TP
.I
LINK_UNUSED
The link is not in use and in initial state.
.TP
.I
LINK_INACTIVE
The link is inactive and will go away.
.TP
.I
LINK_ACTIVATING
The link is being activated with the peer.
.TP
.I
LINK_ACTIVE
The link is active and operates on an established link with the peer.
Data is being exchanged via RDMA.
.SS "Link-UID"
Unique identifier of the link. This identifier consists of link group id and 
link id.
.SS "Peer-UID"
Unique identifier of the link on the peer side. This identifier consists of 
link group id and link id.
.SS "IB-Dev"
Name of the RoCE device used by the link.
.SS "IB-P"
Port of the RoCE device used by the link.
.SS "Local-GID"
GID of the RoCE port used by the link.
.SS "Peer-GID"
GID of the peer RoCE port used by the link.
