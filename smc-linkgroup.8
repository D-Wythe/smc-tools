.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B smc linkgroup
command displays linkgroups, links and their properties. Links can be 
listed only for SMC-R linkgroups. The command operates with type smcr 
per default on all command levels. 

.SS smc linkgroup show - look at the linkgroup properties

.TP
.B all  (default)
Show all the linkgroups.

.TP
.I LG-ID
Show the linkgroup with the id
.I LG-ID

.TP
.BI type " TYPE"
List only linkgroups of the given type.

.TP
.BI netdev " NETDEV"
List linkgroups making use of the given network device only.

.TP
.BI ibdev " IBDEV"
List only linkgroups of the given RoCE (infiniband) device.

.SS smc linkgroup link-show - look at the link properties (SMC-R only)

.TP
.B all  (default)
Show all the links of the linkgroups.

.TP
.I LG-ID
Show links of the linkgroup with the id
.I LG-ID

.TP
.BI type " TYPE"
List only links of the linkgroups of the given type.

.TP
.BI netdev " NETDEV"
List only links of the linkgroups making use of the given network device.

.TP
.BI ibdev " IBDEV"

.SH OUTPUT

.SS "LG-ID"
ID of the linkgroup.
.SS "LG-Role"
Role of the linkgroup.
.TP
.I
SERV
The linkgroup has a SERVER role.
.TP
.I
CLNT
The linkgroup has a CLIENT role.
.SS "LG-Type"
Linkgroup type of the linkgroup.
.TP
.I
NONE
The linkgroup has the initial type.
.TP
.I
SINGLE
The linkgroup has only a single link, i.e.
the local and the peer system can offer one device port only for this linkgroup,
which means a link outage on any side cannot be covered.
.TP
.I
SYM
The linkgroup has two symmetric links, i.e.
the local and the peer system can offer two device ports for this linkgroup,
which means a link outage on any side can be covered.
.TP
.I
ASYMP
The linkgroup has asymmetric links, i.e.
the peer system can offer one device port only for this linkgroup,
which means a link outage on the peer side cannot be covered.
.TP
.I
ASYML
The linkgroup has asymmetric links, i.e.
the local system can offer one device port only for this linkgroup,
which means a link outage on the local side cannot be covered.
.SS "VLAN"
VLAN the linkgroup belongs to.
.SS "#Conns"
Number of connections(sockets) running on the link/linkgroup.
.SS "PNET-ID"
PNET-ID of the linkgroup. "*" means PNET-ID is set by the user. 
.SS "Net-Dev"
Network device name corresponding to the link.
.SS "Link-State"
The state of the link.
.TP
.I
LINK_UNUSED
The link is not in use and in initial state.
.TP
.I
LINK_INACTIVE
The link is inactive and will go away.
.TP
.I
LINK_ACTIVATING
The link is being activated with the peer.
.TP
.I
LINK_ACTIVE
The link is active and operates on an established link with the peer.
Data is being exchanged via RDMA.
.SS "Link-UID"
Unique identifier of the link. This identifier consists of linkgroup id and 
link id.
.SS "Peer-UID"
Unique identifier of the link on peer side. This identifier consists of 
linkgroup id and link id.
.SS "IB-Dev"
Name of the RoCE device used by the link.
.SS "IB-P"
Port of the RoCE device used by the link.
.SS "Local-GID"
GID of the RoCE port used by the link.
.SS "Peer-GID"
GID of the peer RoCE port used by the link.
